I am a graduate student pursuing masters(MS) in Computer Science at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I am a passionate developer who likes to own the software he builds and loves to build software that operates at a scale. I always look forward to learning new skills that would help me grow as a developer and that would enable me to provide the finest user experience to the largest shareholders (the customers!). Now that you're here, be sure to stalk my profile a bit more, try out bunch of different projects that I've built. Cheers!
