Hey there! This is Daksh. I enjoy maths, brainstorming ideas to solve a particular problem, giving reviews on different decisions being made. I am almost always doing all of this tasks back and forth simultaneously at my job as a software developer.

I currently work for [Signzy](https://signzy.com/) as a fullstack web developer. At work, I mostly work on apps that have a Nodejs backend (assisted by frameworks like loopback, koa etc.) and an Angular frontend, with MongoDB as the database of choice.

Apart from work I always am interested in learning things that help me get better as a developer and as a person. Currently I have been going through a lot of talks by well known developers and exploring the intriguing ideas of functional programming, test driven development (TDD) and the importance of architechture & good coding practices. When I am not doing any of this, I like to indulge in sports.

I graduated from [NIT-K](https://www.nitk.ac.in) in May, 2021 with a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering, and have been learning web development and all the other stuff out of my sheer interest and passion towards tech.

I am open to new opportunities as a web developer.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of technologies I've worked with:
