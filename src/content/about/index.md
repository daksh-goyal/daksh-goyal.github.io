Hey there! This is Daksh. I enjoy maths, brainstorming ideas to solve a particular problem, giving reviews on different decisions being made and writing clean, efficient, maintainable code. I've tried to follow this throughout my work life and now as a student, I've been exploring these things even more.

I am currently a master's degree (MS) in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). Before this I've work with [Signzy Technologies](https://signzy.com/) technologies as a fullstack web developer. At my previous job, I mostly worked on apps that have a Nodejs backend (assisted by frameworks like [loopback](https://loopback.io/), [koa](https://koajs.com/) etc.) and an [Angular](https://angular.io/) frontend, with MongoDB as the database of choice.

Apart from work I always am interested in learning things that help me get better as a developer and as a person. I like to listen to experiences of senior developers who've built software at scale that are used globally. I also am currently learning and pursuing the idea of test driven development. I like to keep at par with the latest trends related to the web, be it [qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) or [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) or [astro](https://astro.build/). For the backend, I am learning [Go](https://go.dev/) language and I think it is a great tool built exactly to suit the current needs - developing apps that work on some kind of cloud. Currently I have been going through a lot of talks by well known developers and exploring the intriguing ideas of functional programming, test driven development (TDD) and the importance of architechture & good coding practices. When I am not doing any of this, I like to indulge in sports.

I am open to new opportunities as a full stack developer, or even specifically as a backend or frontend developer.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of technologies I've worked with:
